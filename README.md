Q: How did you learn Solidity so fast?
A: Before Crypto, I was introduced to programming 5 yrs back. Back then, i learnt scratch (a block programming language for kids). after learning scratch, i enrolled in a IIHT (an education instituation) to learn `C & C++`. after i learnt C & C++, the instituation closed down. learning c & c++ was a pretty cool and fun. then, i started learning Java at another instituation (NIIT, would not recommend as there are many online courses to learn java). passed oracle exam @ ~80% score. then, i started learning web development (html, css and javascript) -- from freeCodeCamp. after that, i started getting dip into python. doing some data science shit, some calc shit etc etc. and during covid-19 pandemic, i restarted my youtube channel by putting some eductional content about python, ai, ml, data science, and some small python projects. as i had all this experience in programming, it was easy for me to learn solidity. :)

Q: Which all programming languages have you learned?
A: Scratch, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Solidity and Rust.
